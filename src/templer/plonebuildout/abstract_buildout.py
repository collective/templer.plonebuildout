Debug mode (sometimes called "Debug/Development Mode") is the correct
setting for running a site under development--it ensures that on-disk
changes to templates and skin scripts are immediately visible, and
allows use of certain add-on debugging/profiling products. Running your
Zope in the foreground (with "bin/plonectl fg" or similar commands)
always puts you in debug mode; this setting controls whether you are
in debug mode even when running in the background.

You should set this to "on" during development; once you are ready to
deploy your site, you change this to "off" in your buildout.cfg.

Security error messages (such as "Unauthorized" errors) in Plone are
intentionally vague--the system doesn't want to reveal too much about
the security configuration in error messages, given that those error
messages may be inappropriately printed out/shared/email and intercepted
by others.

"Verbose security" is a buildout setting that enables significantly more
helpful, detailed unauthorized error messages.

There may be a small security risk in leaving this enabled on a site in
deployment; if you turn it on, you should consider turning it off.
