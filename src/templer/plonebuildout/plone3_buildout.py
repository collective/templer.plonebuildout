This template creates a Plone 3 buildout (for most users, a preferred

*** NOTE: You probably don't want to use this template!

Since Plone 3.1, the preferred way to get a buildout-based setup for
Plone is to use the standard installer for your operating system (the
Windows installer, the Mac installer, or the Unified Installer for
Linux/Unix/BSD). These give you a best-practice, widely-used
setup with an isolated Python and a well-documented buildout.
This template is here for older versions of Plone and for experts
who explicitly want a raw, non-installer-based installation.

(This message is particularly aimed at people following out-of-date
books/documentation that suggest this is the right way to get
a Plone-based buildout. This is no longer the case.)
